# Cookie-Manipulation-Challenge

This is a mini CTF challenge I made where you must figure out how to sign in as the admin user by manipulating the session cookie's value. If you want to give it a go, I will keep the site deployed for a while @[thejamjar.xyz](thejamjar.xyz) until my free Linode credit runs out. Or you could just run it on localhost, but you will need a web server, along with the mysqld service running with a database configured.
